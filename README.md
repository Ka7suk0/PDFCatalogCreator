# PythonCatalogCreator
This project takes a list of products from a CSV file and generates a PDF catalog from it. The document includes an index by categories, allowing for products to be unordered in the CSV. Additionally, the program downloads product images only once, so each time the program is run and new products are added, it will only download the new images, saving time by downloading them only the first time.

Each product includes the following data:
- Product ID
- Brand
- Image link
- Product name
- Category

Furthermore, customization options are available for the cover background image and the highlight color for headers and footers.
